# scopus-queries
These are the Scopus queries used in the paper "The changing influence of journal data sharing policies on local RDM practices."

These scripts were massively informed by John Kitchin's blog post: http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/04/03/Getting-data-from-the-Scopus-API/

The work described in the paper consists of two separate scripts. 

1_get_scopus_ids.py: Given a CSV list of ISSNs, the script will search using the Scopus Search API<sup>[1]</sup> to retrieve a list of all
articles within a given year range for which any author is from a designated institution. This script will output a CSV of Scopus article
IDs called 'scopusids.csv'.

2_get_article_info.py: Given a CSV list of Scopus IDs (like the ones generated by the previous script), the script will 
use the Scopus Abstracts Retrieval API<sup>[2]</sup> to determine whether or not the 'Corresponding Author' for a given article is from a defined
institution. If so, the following information will be retrieved and written to a CSV for further analysis:
  - Corresponding Author's Affiliation
  - Corresponding Author's email address
  - Journal ISSN
  - Journal Title
  - Year of publication
